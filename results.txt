Average Val Dice: 0.4310  
Key Observations:  
 Fold 4 achieved the highest Dice score (0.5071) and lowest Hausdorff distance (35.36).  
 Training loss consistently decreased across all folds.  
 Early folds showed instability (e.g., warnings about `nan/inf` distances).  


Training Time: ~2023 seconds per epoch (varies by fold).
